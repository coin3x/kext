Additional extensions for [Allan Wang](https://github.com/AllanWang)'s [KAU library](https://github.com/AllanWang/KAU)

## Documentation

Yet to be added, but I think functions are easy to understand at least while I get the time to add the documentation.

## Import

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```

Add the dependency
```groovy
dependencies {
		compile 'me.jahirfiquitiva:KAUExtensions:712d264'
}
```

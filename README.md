# KAUExtensions

Additional extension for [Allan Wang](https://github.com/AllanWang)'s [KAU library](https://github.com/AllanWang/KAU)

## Documentation

Yet to be added, but I think functions are easy to understand at least while I get the time to add the documentation.

## Import

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Add the dependency
```groovy
	dependencies {
	        compile 'me.jahirfiquitiva:KAUExtensions:c9347c9'
	}
```
